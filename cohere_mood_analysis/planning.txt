for diary entry:
may have to parse individual sentences and analyze sentiment for each, then one song for each sentence?
(yes!) --> alternatively, one long entry, and then a lot of songs that fit the same profile

(yes!) output from cohere mood training file: three-letter code to represent the emotion:
hap = happy
hyp = hyped
sad = sad
ang = angry
tir = tired
neu = neutral

then correspond each emotion to some spotify attributes:
min/max/target danceability
min/max/target energy
min/max/target loudness
min/max/target valence (valence = positiveness!!)

happy : 
    0.8 min_valence,
    0.8 min_energy,
    0.7 min_danceability

hyped :
    0.85 min_valence,
    0.85 min_danceability,
    0.7 min_loudness,
    0.85 min_energy

sad :
    0.25 max_valence,
    0.3 max_danceability

angry :
    0.4 max_valence,
    0.6 min_loudness,
    0.5 min_energy

tired :
    0.4 max_valence,
    0.25 max_energy,
    0.4 max_loudness

neutral :
    0.5 target_danceability,
    0.5 target_loudness,
    0.5 target_energy

for all these: if max, then 


and ideally spotify will make the playlist there based on those attributes
