for diary entry:
may have to parse individual sentences and analyze sentiment for each, then one song for each sentence?
(yes!) --> alternatively, one long entry, and then a lot of songs that fit the same profile

(yes!) output from cohere mood training file: three-letter code to represent the emotion:
hap = happy
hyp = hyped
sad = sad
ang = angry
tir = tired
neu = neutral

then correspond each emotion to some spotify attributes:
min/max/target danceability
min/max/target energy
min/max/target loudness
min/max/target valence (valence = positiveness!!)

happy : 
    min_valence,
    min_energy,
    min_danceability

hyped :
    min_valence,
    min_danceability,
    min_loudness,
    min_energy

sad :
    max_valence,
    max_danceability

angry :
    max_valence,
    min_loudness,
    min_energy

tired :
    max_valence,
    max_energy,
    max_loudness

neutral :
    target_danceability,
    target_loudness,
    target_energy

and ideally spotify will make the playlist there based on those attributes
